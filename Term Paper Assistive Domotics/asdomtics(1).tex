	Assistive technology is the form of home automation which includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them.Microsoft Corporationâ€™s C.E.O. Steve Ballmer once said "The number one benefit of technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive."The US Census Bureau has projected that by 2010 13\% of the population will be 65 or older (Cheek 2005). The bureau has also projected that by 2030 there will be 9 million Americans older than 85 (Cheek 2005).
